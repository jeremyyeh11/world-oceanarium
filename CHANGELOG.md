# Changelog

Significant changes only. Categorized by feature area inside each clean release/version grouping.

Versioning convention notes:
- Current convention: work toward a clean target release using visible `-dev_##` builds, then publish the clean version when accepted.
- Dev patches are intentionally excluded below; each target release summarizes the accepted bucket.
- Before the dev-patch convention, changes are grouped by minor version (`v0.6.x`, `v0.5.x`, etc.).
- Earliest unversioned work is grouped as `pre-v0.x`.

## v0.7.3 — Public launch shell polish

Status: in progress as `v0.7.3-dev_11`.

### Screenshot/share polish

- Added screenshot mode from the tank top controls.
- Hid all app UI, fish info cards, debug overlays, version label, and tank labels while screenshot mode is active.
- Added a persistent acknowledgement prompt with platform-specific exit instructions.
- Set desktop exit to `Esc` and mobile/touch exit to long-press anywhere.
- Kept screenspace lighting/exposure visible in screenshot mode so captures preserve the intended tank look.
- Hid the selected/followed fish silhouette in screenshot mode while preserving the follow camera state.
- Replaced the crowded top-right icon row with a consistent hamburger menu that drops tank controls vertically.
- Kept search as a top-level button beside the hamburger while screenshot/audio/fullscreen stay inside the dropdown.
- Animated the hamburger icon to rotate open while menu icons pour/slide downward with a short stagger.
- Added the matching reverse animation so dropdown icons slide back up into the hamburger when closing.
- Added Jeremy-uploaded favicon and Apple touch icon assets for public launch polish.
- Fixed mobile search expansion so the input anchors to the search button and stays inside the viewport beside the hamburger.
- Reworked mobile expanded search into the top controls flex row so it fills the available space between the back button and hamburger with consistent icon spacing.

## v0.7.2 — Audio + mobile follow polish

### Audio foundation

- Added procedural underwater ambience for the tank.

  - overall mix
  - ambient channel

- Maintained mobile master volume while reducing desktop master volume by 50%.
- Extended fish SFX envelopes so sounds play fully instead of blipping.
- Trimmed/faded an uploaded burst-audio artifact.

### Audio lifecycle

- Scoped audio to the tank:
